question below(Create a new vue js application using the cli then simulate a fake authentication experience using vuex and vue router. Make sure that you make provisions for wildcard routes a.k.a 404 pages. Also, your fake authentication experience should consist of the login route - ‘/login’,  the sign up route  - ‘/signup’ and the products route - ‘/products’. Users shouldn’t be able to access the products route until they’re logged in and they shouldn’t be able to access the login route if they’re already logged in. In this exercise I hope to see the use of nested routes for the navigation menu that will show on each page, and authguards)
